This project requires NodeJs in order to run, since it is a console program.It also requres MySql to be installed in order to run. After Node is installed, download the project to your computer and navigate to the directory in a console. Use the command 'npm install' to install the dependencies, then navigate to the db folder, log into your MySQL server and run 'source schema.sql' to initiate the directory. Optional you can run 'seeds.sql' to put some example data into the database. After you've done that, navigate to the root directory and run 'node index.js' to get started.
